This Quarto project analyzes youth education completion rates globally by merging UNICEF education data with World Bank development indicators.
Through a series of visualizations including world maps, scatter plots, bubble charts, and box plots, the report explores indirect relationships between education, economic prosperity, and life expectancy.
The analysis highlights persistent global disparities, emphasizing the need for targeted investments in education infrastructure and social policies.
Python (pandas, plotly, plotnine) and Quarto were used to build an interactive, code-transparent HTML report.
The final project supports the broader understanding of educationâ€™s role as both a driver and outcome of sustainable development progress.
